# Customer-Segmentation
This project focuses on analyzing customer data to segment customers and predict their Customer Lifetime Value (CLV). It uses a machine learning approach to help businesses understand and predict the value each customer can bring over time. Here's a brief overview:

Key Features:
Customer Data Segmentation:
Features like annual income and spending habits are used to group customers for targeted strategies.
CLV Prediction:A linear regression model is implemented to predict the CLV based on customer features.
CLV helps businesses estimate the long-term value of their customers, aiding in better decision-making.

Performance Metrics:
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²). Current results suggest room for improvement in prediction accuracy.

Purpose:
The project provides a framework for businesses to:
Segment customers effectively.
Make data-driven decisions by estimating potential revenue from different customer groups.
